› please read worknotes.md to learn the recent history of this project. Then create a new directory called agents for us to maintain documentation (in markdown format) that AI agents like you
  or Claude Code CLI can use to understand the project.

• I’m putting together a markdown file like agents/project-overview.md to summarize the project setup, key commands, configuration, and recent history for AI agents. I’ll organize it with
  sections on purpose, repo structure, recent changes, and operational notes, making sure to keep it clear and concise without quoting entire logs. Then I’ll create the file with apply_patch
  using ASCII content and proper formatting.

• Added agents/README.md (+32 -0)
     1 +# FeedLand Agent Guide
     2 +
     3 +## Purpose
     4 +This directory hosts quick-reference docs to help AI coding agents ramp up on the FeedLand codebase. Keep the guidance concise, actionable, and in sync with the main project documentatio
        n.
     5 +
     6 +## Getting Started
     7 +- Entry point: `feedland.js` exports `start()` (HTTP server, sockets, feed checker).
     8 +- Publishing helpers: run `node blog.js` to exercise feed generation logic in isolation.
     9 +- Project relies on CommonJS modules with tab indentation; avoid newer Node features that might break the current LTS runtime.
    10 +
    11 +## Key Commands
    12 +- Install dependencies: `npm install`
    13 +- Start dev server: `node -e 'require("./feedland").start()'`
    14 +- Blog utilities: `node blog.js`
    15 +
    16 +## Configuration Notes
    17 +- Default config lives in `utils/config.json`; never commit real credentials.
    18 +- Ensure any new config values are set before `database.start()` so they persist to the database layer.
    19 +- Operational assets (e.g. `emailtemplate.html`, `worknotes.md`) must stay aligned with user-facing changes.
    20 +
    21 +## Recent History (see `worknotes.md` for detail)
    22 +- **10/26/25**: Released feedlanddatabase v0.8.3; `/getRiver` reimplemented using a join-based query.
    23 +- **9/5/25**: Added `metadata` JSON column support (feedlanddatabase v0.8.2); wpidentity bumped to v0.5.25.
    24 +- **3/23/24**: Introduced `/getuserinfowithwordpresstoken` endpoint.
    25 +- **3/17/24**: Increased feed checker frequency; review `startFeedChecker`.
    26 +- **2/26/24**: Added `config.httpRequestTimeoutSecs` (default 1) for the feed reader.
    27 +
    28 +## Contribution Reminders
    29 +- Follow `//MM/DD/YY by DW` comment style when documenting behavior changes.
    30 +- Prefer manual smoke tests; record what you exercised when proposing changes.
    31 +- Keep `emailtemplate.html` and other shipped assets current when flows change.

• I’m wrapping up by noting the creation of the new agents directory and its README starting at line 1, highlighting key contents like project structure and recent notes. I’ll also mention that
  no tests were run and suggest next steps such as expanding the documentation further. This final message will follow the requested formatting with a clear header and bullet points.

─ Worked for 23s ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Documentation

  - Added agents/README.md:1 providing an onboarding guide for AI agents with repo layout tips, core commands, config reminders, and a snapshot of the latest worknotes context.

  No tests run; none applicable for doc-only change.

  Next: 1) Flesh out agent docs with deeper subsystem guides as needs emerge.


› please also create a tests directory where we will put automated tests


• Ran mkdir -p tests
  └ (no output)

─ Worked for 4s ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Created the tests directory at repo root; ready for future automated test suites. No new files inside yet.


› Are you familiar with OPML?


• Yes—OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) is an XML format for representing outlines. In FeedLand it’s typically used for lists of feeds (reading lists, templates in docs/). Let me know if
  you need help generating or parsing it.


› No, I know the format also and was present with the designer (Dave Winer who also created this project) at its inception, and have used it extensively. He uses it for editing structured text,
  including JavaScript.


• That’s great context—working directly with the format’s originator definitely beats any crash course. If you want to capture any OPML-specific conventions for this repo (tooling expectations,
  how the templates map to features, etc.), I can add them to the new agents docs whenever you’re ready.


› What I want is for you to read through all of the OPML files in the docs directory and capture any key learning in markdown documents in the agents directory. It would also be good to make a
  document summarizing how this project is structured, what dependencies it has, and anything else from the OPML docs that you think is important for developers to know.

     1 +# FeedLand OPML Field Notes
     2 +
     3 +## `about.opml`
     4 +- FeedLand frames feeds, news, and people as a shared community; all feed lists and categories are public.
     5 +- The Feed List page is the primary control surface: sortable columns, inline five-item previews, category tagging, and quick subscription toggles.
     6 +- Feed Info pages surface feed metadata (link, description, categories, subscribers, read time, rssCloud status) and expose manual refresh plus subscribe/unsubscribe actions.
     7 +- Reading views include a multi-tab river (category-driven), per-feed rivers, and a mailbox view; navigation menus adjust contextually (e.g., View menu on feed info).
     8 +- Settings dialog tabs: Categories, News Products, Linker (default Radio3 URL for linkblogging), and Misc (news-as-home toggle, live ticker, background update suppression).
     9 +
    10 +## `categories.opml`
    11 +- Users define custom categories (comma-separated) and can optionally choose a subset for News page tabs.
    12 +- Feed-level category assignment uses a live checkbox dialog (tag icon) with immediate persistence and next/prev feed navigation.
    13 +- Categories can drive News Product tabs by specifying outline attributes (`type`, `screenname`, `catname`) and can be exported as OPML (`/opml?screenname=&catname=`).
    14 +- "All" acts as an implicit catch-all if included; removing a category leaves existing feed labels intact.
    15 +
    16 +## `firstThings.opml`
    17 +- New users log in with email, seed subscriptions via hotlists/user lists, and are encouraged to onboard gradually rather than bulk-importing OPML.
    18 +- Feed discovery emphasizes community transparency—every user's feed list is visible and subscribable.
    19 +- News reading starts from the Feed List (wedge expanders) or the My News river view.
    20 +
    21 +## `hello.opml`
    22 +- Context setter from Dave Winer: FeedLand began summer 2022 with a small tester cohort; participation is curated but documentation is open to all.
    23 +
    24 +## `misc.opml`
    25 +- Bookmarks feature mirrors Drummer's outline-based menu: timeline bookmark icon or "Add Bookmark" menu entry writes to a shared outline, edited via the standard outliner UX.
    26 +- Likes generate per-user RSS feeds (`data.feedland.org/likes/<screenname>.xml`) once the first item is liked; only logged-in users can like content.
    27 +
    28 +## `newsProducts.opml`
    29 +- News Products are one-page sites (e.g., `my.feedland.org/<screenname>`) populated by FeedLand categories; custom domains can CNAME to these.
    30 +- News Product setup flows through Settings → Categories (third textbox defines product tabs) and Settings → News Products (title, description, hero image, inline CSS/JS).
    31 +- Advanced templates leverage OPML outlines with includes, category tabs, and editable HTML sections (must retain `divNewsProduct` root; river injects beneath `idRiverContent`).
    32 +- Feeds need at least one subscriber for content to appear—FeedLand skips fetching unsubscribed feeds.
    33 +- Template macros surface previously defined metadata; questions are tracked via feedlandSupport issue discussions.
    34 +
    35 +## `tech.opml`
    36 +- Documents app surface types: single-category rivers, single-feed rivers, multi-tab rivers (My news), mailbox reader, feed list, subscription log, and hotlist archives.
    37 +- Feed List instrumentation: wedge expanders, subscription checkboxes (hot updates), category dialog access, subscriber counts, and stats tooltips.
    38 +- Highlights operational constraints like anonymous river access and plans for hotlist archives.
    39 +
    40 +## `yourFeed.opml`
    41 +- Every user gets a personal feed (`data.feedland.org/feeds/<screenname>.xml`) editable via the My Feed page (create, update, cancel controls).
    42 +- Feed items store both HTML and `source:markdown`, encouraging Markdown-first authoring while preserving HTML output.
    43 +- April 2023 additions: editable title/link/enclosure metadata, bookmarklet for linkblogging (`https://feedland.org/?linkblog=true&…`), and optional Linker setting swap to loop the retwe
        et icon back into FeedLand.
    44 +- Saved enclosures yield RSS `<enclosure>` elements with type and size; bookmarklet text pre-fills edit boxes when invoked.

• I’m putting together a detailed project-structure document in agents/project-structure.md that will cover how services and directories are organized, core data models and workflows from the
  OPML files, key dependencies and supporting services identified in instructions and worknotes, and relevant configuration and operational details developers should know. I plan to break it
  into clear sections like Overview, Modules & directories, Key workflows, Dependencies & Integrations, and Configuration & operational notes with concise bullet points for clarity.

• Added agents/project-structure.md (+29 -0)
     1 +# FeedLand Project Structure & Dependencies
     2 +
     3 +## Service Layout
     4 +- `feedland.js` is the Node entry point; it wires `start()` to the HTTP server, websocket notifications, and scheduled feed checks.
     5 +- `blog.js` hosts publishing helpers and feed generation logic; run with `node blog.js` for isolated exercise.
     6 +- `database/` integrates the `feedlandDatabase` package; keep schema-related config values (`flFeedsHaveIds`, `httpRequestTimeoutSecs`, `metadata` JSON column support) synchronized befor
        e `database.start()`.
     7 +- `utils/` contains shared helpers plus the sample `config.json`; remember to provide instance-specific overrides outside source control.
     8 +- `docs/` ships OPML documentation and templates referenced across the app (news products, onboarding, categories, personal feed guidance).
     9 +- `agents/` (new) centralizes AI-facing docs like this overview and OPML field notes; `tests/` is staged for future automation.
    10 +
    11 +## User-Facing Flows (from OPML docs)
    12 +- Feed discovery centers on the Feed List (sortable columns, inline previews, category tags, subscriber counts) with universal read access across users.
    13 +- Reading modes include multi-tab rivers (category tabs), feed-specific rivers, and a mailbox view; settings govern defaults and live update behavior.
    14 +- Categories drive News pages, News Products, and OPML exports (`/opml?screenname=&catname=`); assignments persist in real time via the feed list tag dialog.
    15 +- News Products render on `my.feedland.org/<screenname>` using template outlines that can pull categories, includes, and custom HTML under `divNewsProduct`.
    16 +- Every account exposes a personal feed (`data.feedland.org/feeds/<screenname>.xml`) supporting Markdown + HTML content, linkblog bookmarklets, and RSS enclosures.
    17 +- Engagement features include outline-based bookmarks and per-user Likes feeds (`data.feedland.org/likes/<screenname>.xml`).
    18 +
    19 +## Dependencies & Integrations
    20 +- Core NPM packages mentioned in worknotes: `feedlanddatabase` (v0.8.3), `wpidentity` (v0.5.25), `sqllog`, and the Dave-owned `daveappserver`.
    21 +- Feed fetching leverages the `reallySimple` reader (tied to `config.httpRequestTimeoutSecs`), with rssCloud renewal for instant updates when supported.
    22 +- External apps referenced by docs: Drummer (outliner/bookmarks), Radio3 (default linkblog target), OPML viewers (xmlviewer.scripting.com).
    23 +- Websocket update socket defaults to `wss://drummer.land/`, matching OPML head metadata.
    24 +
    25 +## Configuration & Operations
    26 +- Keep `worknotes.md` aligned with behavior changes; many config defaults (e.g., `flCanUseFeedIds`, `flFeedsHaveIds`) are documented there chronologically.
    27 +- `config.json` samples must never include production secrets; ensure any new keys are injected before startup to propagate into database config mirrors.
    28 +- rssCloud renewals run roughly every 23 hours; manual feed refresh and stats are surfaced on Feed Info pages for troubleshooting.
    29 +- Bookmarklet and template URLs in docs should be treated as canonical references when restoring user-facing flows.

  changes, and offer a brief optional suggestion for expanding the docs if helpful.

─ Worked for 2m 55s ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Updates

  - Captured per-file takeaways from every OPML doc so agents can grok categories, news products, personal feeds, bookmarks, and other workflows quickly in agents/opml-field-notes.md:1.
  - Wrote a broader agent briefing on service layout, key flows, and known dependencies (feedlanddatabase, wpidentity, reallySimple, rssCloud, Radio3) in agents/project-structure.md:1.
  - Tests: not run (documentation-only work).

  Next step you may want: 1) Extend the new docs with database schema notes or API call references once those are collated.


› Please go ahead and document both the database schema and API, in one markdocument each.

  API endpoints by HTTP method, grouping them by functionality, and noting where I need to dig deeper into source code for specifics, especially for POST routes like /opmlsubscribe and /
  setfeedsubscount. This will help me build a clear and thorough API doc.

  consider mentioning that some entities like riverCache aren't persistent tables but in-memory caches. This will help make the documentation both detailed and clear.

     1 +# FeedLand Database Cheat Sheet
     2 +
     3 +FeedLand uses MySQL via `davesql`, with connection details supplied through `config.database`. Tables are managed with MySQL `REPLACE` semantics (so each logical key must stay unique), a
        nd foreign keys are enforced in code rather than in SQL. Below is a field-level map distilled from `database/database.js` (v0.8.3) as shipped in this repo.
     4 +
     5 +## `feeds`
     6 +- **Keying**: unique on `feedUrl`; optional auto-increment `feedId` when `config.flFeedsHaveIds` discovers the column.
     7 +- **Core columns**: `feedUrl`, `feedId`, `title`, `htmlUrl`, `description`, `pubDate`, `whenCreated`, `whenUpdated`.
     8 +- **Counters/health**: `ctItems`, `ctSubs`, `ctSecs` (last read duration), `ctChecks`, `ctErrors`, `ctConsecutiveErrors`, `errorString`.
     9 +- **Timestamps**: `whenChecked`, `whenLastError`, `whenLastCloudRenew`.
    10 +- **rssCloud**: `urlCloudServer`, `ctCloudRenews`.
    11 +- **Source metadata**: `copyright`, `generator`, `language`, `managingEditor`, `webMaster`, `docs`, `ttl`, `twitterAccount`.
    12 +- **Image block**: `imageUrl`, `imageTitle`, `imageLink`, `imageWidth`, `imageHeight`, `imageDescription`.
    13 +- **Provenance**: `whoFirstSubscribed` captures the first user to add the feed.
    14 +
    15 +## `items`
    16 +- **Keying**: unique on (`feedUrl`, `guid`); optional `feedId` when feeds have IDs.
    17 +- **Core columns**: `id` (auto-increment), `feedUrl`, `feedId`, `guid`, `title`, `link`, `description`, `pubDate`.
    18 +- **Timestamps**: `whenCreated` (ingest time), `whenUpdated` (last change).
    19 +- **Content variants**: `markdowntext`, `outlineJsontext` (serialized outline payloads).
    20 +- **Enclosures**: `enclosureUrl`, `enclosureType`, `enclosureLength`.
    21 +- **Engagement**: `likes` (comma-delimited usernames), `ctLikes` is derived at runtime.
    22 +- **Lifecycle**: `flDeleted` toggled when pruning.
    23 +- **Metadata**: `metadata` (JSON string added in v0.8.2 for WordPress IDs and similar).
    24 +- **Indexes**: code expects an index named `itemsIndex2` covering feed identity (feedId/ feedUrl) and `pubDate` for river queries.
    25 +
    26 +## `subscriptions`
    27 +- **Keying**: unique on (`listName`, `feedUrl`, `urlReadingList`), implemented with `REPLACE`.
    28 +- **Core columns**: `listName` (user screenname), `feedUrl`, `feedId` (when available), `whenUpdated`.
    29 +- **Categorisation**: `categories` stored as a lowercase comma-wrapped string (`,all,tech,nyt,`), enabling SQL `LIKE` lookups.
    30 +- **Reading lists**: `urlReadingList` non-empty when the sub originates from a reading list; blank/NULL for direct subs.
    31 +- **Notes**: `addSubscription` seeds `",all,"` and refreshes `feeds.ctSubs` via `setFeedSubsCount`.
    32 +
    33 +## `users`
    34 +- **Identity**: `screenname` (primary), `emailAddress`, `emailSecret` (invite/login shared secret), `role`.
    35 +- **Lifecycle**: `whenCreated`, `whenUpdated`, `ctStartups`, `whenLastStartup`.
    36 +- **Preferences**: `categories`, `homePageCategories`, `newsproductCategoryList`, `newsproductTitle`, `newsproductDescription`, `newsproductImage`, `newsproductStyle`, `newsproductScript
        `.
    37 +- **Personal feed**: `myFeedTitle`, `myFeedDescription`.
    38 +- **Apps**: `apps` JSON blob (stored as text; parsed on read).
    39 +- **Security**: `emailSecret` is stripped before returning user data to callers.
    40 +
    41 +## `likes`
    42 +- **Keying**: unique on (`listName`, `itemId`) via `REPLACE`.
    43 +- **Columns**: `listName` (screenname), `itemId` (foreign key to `items.id`), `emotion` (currently 1), `whenCreated`.
    44 +- **Feed generation**: `buildLikesFeed` joins `likes` to `items` to publish RSS when `config.flLikesFeeds` is enabled.
    45 +
    46 +## `readinglists`
    47 +- **Keying**: unique on `opmlUrl`.
    48 +- **Columns**: `opmlUrl`, `title`, `description`, `whenCreated`, `whenChecked`, `ctChecks`, `whoFirstSubscribed`, `feedUrls` (JSON array of subscribed feeds).
    49 +- **Usage**: `checkReadingList` refreshes the outline, updates `feedUrls`, and drives subscription diffs against `subscriptions`.
    50 +
    51 +## `readinglistsubscriptions`
    52 +- **Keying**: unique on (`screenname`, `opmlUrl`).
    53 +- **Columns**: `screenname`, `opmlUrl`, `whenCreated`.
    54 +- **Workflow**: drives batch subscribe/unsubscribe operations into `subscriptions` with `urlReadingList` populated so individual feeds can later be cleaned up.
    55 +
    56 +## Operational Notes
    57 +- Backups: `backupDatabase` (opt-in) writes JSON snapshots (`feeds.json`, `items/YYYY/MM/DD.json`, etc.) under `data/backups/` and, if configured, mirrors to GitHub/S3.
    58 +- Cleanup: `config.ctRiverCutoffDays` works with `flDeleted` to age out river data; ensure pruning jobs respect both `items` and `subscriptions`.
    59 +- rssCloud: `rssCloudRenew` fields on `feeds` are critical—renewals run every ~23 hours when `config.flRenewSubscriptions` is true.
    60 +- Feed IDs: When the `feedId` column exists, new code paths prefer integer joins (`flFeedsHaveIds` / `flCanUseFeedIds`). Keep `items`, `feeds`, and `subscriptions` in sync if you add the
         column manually.

      1 +# FeedLand HTTP API Reference
      2 +
      3 +The server bootstraps `daveappserver` with `handleHttpRequest` (see `feedland.js`). Requests are split on verb, and most JSON responses go through `httpReturn`, which emits `application
         /json`. Routes that call `returnOpml`, `returnHtml`, or `returnPlainText` change the MIME type accordingly.
      4 +
      5 +Authentication relies on `callWithScreenname`, which in turn calls `getScreenname` (Twitter/email cookie checks inside `daveappserver`). Any route wrapped with `callWithScreenname` requ
         ires the caller to be logged in; others are open.
      6 +
      7 +## POST Endpoints
      8 +- `POST /opmlsubscribe` *(auth required)* — Subscribes the current user to every feed in an OPML outline posted in the body. Optional query flag `flDeleteEnabled` prunes feeds no longer
          present.
      9 +- `POST /sendprefs` *(auth required)* — Batch updates user preferences from the raw POST body (JSON).
     10 +- `POST config.rssCloud.feedUpdatedCallback` (defaults to `/feedupdated`) — Incoming rssCloud webhook; expects a URL-encoded body with `url`, responds with a plain-text acknowledgment.
     11 +
     12 +## GET Endpoints
     13 +
     14 +### Feed Fetching & Metadata
     15 +- `GET /returnjson` — Proxy `reallysimple.readFeed`, returning parsed feed JSON for `url`.
     16 +- `GET /returnopml` — Same as above but serialized to OPML (XML).
     17 +- `GET /checkfeednow` *(open)* — Triggers `database.checkOneFeed(url)` to refresh immediately.
     18 +- `GET /getupdatedfeed` *(open)* — Reads the feed (and latest items) fresh from the network, then returns the normalized feed record.
     19 +- `GET /getfeedrec` *(open)* — Returns the raw database row for `url`.
     20 +- `GET /getfeed` *(open)* — Returns the converted API feed record from the database (no network touch).
     21 +- `GET /getfeeditems` *(open)* — Returns recent items for `url`; optional `maxItems`.
     22 +- `GET /getfeedlist` *(open)* — Lists every `feedUrl` currently stored.
     23 +- `GET /getfeedlistfromopml` *(open)* — Fetches a remote OPML, returning the contained feed URLs and metadata.
     24 +- `GET /getfeedsearch` *(open)* — Full-text search against feed titles (see `database.getFeedSearch`).
     25 +- `GET /setfeedsubscount` *(open)* — Recounts subscribers for `url` and updates `feeds.ctSubs`.
     26 +- `GET /checkfeednow`, `/getupdatedfeed`, `/getfeedrec`, `/getfeed` respect `config.flCheckForDeleted` and may omit logically deleted items.
     27 +
     28 +### Likes & Engagement
     29 +- `GET /togglelike` *(auth required)* — Toggles the caller’s like for `id` (an item primary key); updates both `items.likes` and the `likes` table.
     30 +- `GET /getlikes` *(auth required)* — Returns the like roster for item `id`.
     31 +- `GET /getalotoflikes` *(auth required)* — Intended to batch-fetch likes given an `idarray`. The current `database` module in this repo no longer exports `getALotOLikes`, so this route
          will throw unless that helper is restored.
     32 +- `GET /getlikesxml` — Triggers `database.buildLikesFeed`, returning RSS XML (requires `config.flLikesFeeds`).
     33 +- `GET /getfollowers` — Returns the list of users subscribed to `url`.
     34 +
     35 +### Subscriptions & Categories
     36 +- `GET /subscribe` *(auth required)* — Adds the feed at `url` to the caller’s list; auto-creates OPML entries when `flMaintainFeedsOpml` is true.
     37 +- `GET /unsubscribe` *(auth required)* — Removes the feed at `url` from the caller.

     40 +- `GET /getusersubcriptions` *(open)* — Returns the subscription array for `screenname` (defaults to caller if omitted).
     41 +- `GET /setsubscriptioncategories` *(auth required)* — Updates the category set for a subscription (`jsontext` is a JSON array of category names).
     42 +- `GET /getfeedsincategory` *(auth required)* — Returns the caller’s feeds filtered by `catname`. Pass `screenname` to inspect someone else’s categories.

     47 +- `GET /gethotlist` — Returns hotlist metadata in JSON.
     48 +
     49 +### Rivers & News Products
     50 +- `GET /getriver` — Dual-mode: if `url` is provided, builds a river from an OPML list; otherwise fetches the river for `screenname` (defaults to caller).

     52 +- `GET /getriverfromopml` — River from a remote OPML file.
     53 +- `GET /getriverfromcategory` — River for `screenname` limited to `catname`.
     54 +- `GET /getriverfromeverything` — Global river (`items` newest first).
     55 +- `GET /getriverfromhotlist` — River from the current hotlist.
     56 +- `GET /getriverfromuserfeeds` — Union river for every user’s feed list.
     57 +- `GET /getriverfromreadinglist` — River sourced from a reading list OPML.
     58 +- `GET /newsproduct` — Renders a full HTML page. Supply `username` to render a user’s product, or `template`/`spec` (OPML or JSON) for template-driven output.
     59 +
     60 +### Reading Lists
     61 +- `GET /checkreadinglist` — Refreshes `readinglists` entry for `url`; adds missing feeds to the database.
     62 +- `GET /subscribetoreadinglist` *(auth required)* — Subscribes the caller to the specified OPML reading list (updates `readinglistsubscriptions` and `subscriptions`).
     63 +- `GET /unsubreadinglist` *(auth required)* — Removes the caller from a reading list and cleans up related subscriptions.
     64 +- `GET /getreadinglistsubscriptions` — Lists all reading lists a `screenname` follows.
     65 +- `GET /getreadinglisstinfo` — Batch fetch metadata for multiple reading lists (`jsontext` is a JSON array of OPML URLs).
     66 +- `GET /getreadinglistfollowers` — Lists followers of a reading list.
     67 +- `GET /checkmyreadinglistsubs` *(auth required)* — Forces a reconciliation between the caller and a particular reading list.
     68 +

     70 +- `GET /sendprefs` *(auth required)* — Legacy GET variant; prefer POST.
     71 +- `GET /getallusers` — Returns user summaries joined with subscription counts (`config.maxGetAllUsers` limit).
     72 +- `GET /getuserprefs` *(auth required)* — Returns the caller’s preference record (email secret stripped).
     73 +- `GET /getuserinfo` — Public-safe user info for `screenname`.
     74 +- `GET /isuserindatabase` — Simple existence check for `screenname`.
     75 +- `GET /isemailindatabase` — Validates whether an email is registered (used during login).
     76 +- `GET /getuserinfowithwordpresstoken` — Resolves a WordPress token to user info via `wpidentity`.
     77 +- `GET /regenerateemailsecret` *(auth required)* — Issues a new email login secret and updates the `users` table.
     78 +- `GET /getserverconfig` — Exposes runtime config summary (optionally tailored per `screenname`).
     79 +
     80 +### Blog Utilities
     81 +- `GET /updateblogsettings`, `GET /newblogpost`, `GET /updateblogpost` *(auth required)* — Thin wrappers around `blog.js` for managing personal feed posts (the params are JSON payloads)
         .

     88 +- `GET /getfeedlist` — Dump of all feed URLs.
     89 +- `GET /isfeedinriver` — Checks whether a feed is currently present in a cached river (requires `cachekey`).
     90 +- `GET /returnjson`, `/returnopml` double as debugging proxies for feed URLs.
     91 +- `GET config.rssCloud.feedUpdatedCallback` — Responds to rssCloud handshake challenges by echoing the `challenge` query param.
     92 +
     93 +## Response Conventions
     94 +- Success replies are usually JSON; OPML-producing routes send `text/xml`, `newsproduct` returns HTML, rssCloud callbacks return plain text.
     95 +- Errors bubble through `returnError`, returning HTTP 500 with `{message}`.
     96 +- `REPLACE`-style mutations often return the row as acknowledged by MySQL (e.g., subscriptions, likes).
     97 +
     98 +## Known Gaps
     99 +- `GET /getalotoflikes` references `database.getALotOLikes`, which is not defined in `database/database.js` in this repo snapshot. Restore the helper or remove the route before exposing
          it.
    100 +- Some admin-leaning routes (`/setfeedsubscount`, `/getcurrentriverbuildlog`) lack explicit auth checks; gate them via the proxy or add role checks if you deploy multi-tenant instances.

• Explored
  └ List agents
    Read database-schema.md, api-overview.md

• Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Survey repository for database schema definitions and API endpoints
    ✔ Draft agents/database-schema.md and agents/api-overview.md with concise developer guidance
    ✔ Review docs for coherence and repository alignment

• I'll create a concise bullet-point summary outlining the new documentation files with line references, note the missing route in docs, mention tests weren't run, and suggest verifying or
  restoring the missing function next.

─ Worked for 8m 21s ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• - Added a schema cheat sheet covering every table, key columns, and operational quirks (agents/database-schema.md:1).
  - Captured the HTTP surface area with auth requirements, response formats, and known gaps like the missing getALotOLikes helper (agents/api-overview.md:1).
  - Tests: not run (documentation-only change).

  Next: 1) Decide whether to reintroduce database.getALotOLikes or retire GET /getalotoflikes so the documented gap is resolved.


› I don't want you to do either of the propsed next steps. I'm in code review mode right now. Can you propose a good place where we can document potential clean-up work or other code-review-
  related information? The agents directory doesn't seem like the right place, but docs is sacrosanct since it's a hierarchy that was created and is owned by Dave. I'm a little bit at a loss on
  this. :\


• Here are a few spots that fit without colliding with Dave’s docs:

  - Root REVIEWS.md – keeps review pointers top-level and easy to find, similar to README.md patterns.
  - notes/ directory – create a sibling to agents/ that we clearly mark as “team-owned scratchpad” for backlog, cleanup ideas, and review follow-ups.
  - .github/ subfolder (e.g., .github/review-notes.md) – lives in infra space already used for tooling, invisible to production assets, but documented enough for collaborators.

  Any of these let us jot cleanup tasks and review findings without touching Dave’s OPML tree. Pick whichever best matches how visible you want the list to be.


› I like the notes directory idea. What file should we start with for code review notes?


• Let’s start with notes/code-review-notes.md. It’s descriptive, scoped to review follow-ups, and leaves room for other note files in the same folder later.


› Sure, sounds good. Can you also create a template doc for us to follow, which maintains as many of the conventions as you can from what you know so far from your OPML docs review and git
  commit notes? I want to stay close to the original author's style here.


• I’m preparing to create a notes directory along with two Markdown files: one (code-review-notes.md) as a starter log with instructions pointing to the template, and the other (code-review-
  template.md) structured as a template with sample entries and guidelines that stick closely to the existing style using #### headings, narrative text with bullets for tasks, and clear
  placeholders for date, time, and initials. I plan to ensure the template fits well with the user’s note and comment conventions and get ready to use shell commands to create the directory.

     9 +- Related files or endpoints: feedland.js (`GET /getalotoflikes`), database/database.js exports

    11 +Highlights:
    12 +- Finding: `feedland.js` exposes `GET /getalotoflikes`, delegating to `database.getALotOLikes`, but `database/database.js` no longer exports that function (source shows it commented out
        in `database/source.opml`).
    13 +- Observation: Any request to `/getalotoflikes` will throw `TypeError: database.getALotOLikes is not a function`, bubbling a 500 to clients; breaks bulk-like retrievals used by legacy UI
         pieces.
    14 +- Observation: Code comments indicate the helper once lived in `viewers.js`; when logic moved into `database/database.js`, the export was omitted, leaving stale API surface.

    15 +- Dependency & supply chain hygiene: lock npm versions, enable automated advisories, and define an update cadence aligned with worknotes releases.
    16 +- Documentation & support readiness: expand operator notes (`worknotes.md`, `notes/`), clarify onboarding steps for new communities, and prepare customer-facing FAQs in sync with marketi
        ng.

› Question: Is the content in agents equally valuable for human contributors? Maybe this directory should be renamed?


• Those write-ups are absolutely useful for humans too—they’re quick briefings on entry points, OPML usage, structure, schema, and API touchpoints. If you want the directory name to reflect
  that broader audience, consider something neutral like guides/ or briefings/, or even fold them into the main notes/ tree. The content itself doesn’t need to change; only rename if you think
  “agents” gives the wrong signal.


› I suggest "contributing" or similar. What do you think? Also should it live under notes or in its own top-level directory based on content we've already authored?


• “Contributing” works nicely—it suggests “how to get oriented and help,” which fits those briefs. I’d keep it top-level rather than under notes/:

  - notes/ is a catch-all for operational scratchpads and review artifacts; mixing contributor guidance into the same tree will make it harder to spot.
  - A dedicated contributing/ (or contributors/) directory sets the expectation that these are onboarding/knowledge docs—parallel to docs/ but without colliding with Dave’s OPML hierarchy.

  So I’d rename agents/ → contributing/, keep the existing files as-is, and link to that directory from the main README when you’re ready.

› What should we review first? I'm thinking a security review is a good start.


• I agree—start with the security review. It’ll uncover auth, data-handling, and dependency risks early, and the findings naturally drive priorities for the other tracks (monitoring, privacy,
  testing). Once we have that baseline, we can sequence the remaining work in order of risk mitigation (e.g., data handling and DR next).


› So you know, the data that this app consumes is generally assumed to be public, since the app is inherently a publishing app. But I'm concerned about user secrets and cross-site
  vulnerabilities. Let's approach this as a dialog and then once we're done write up our findings. Sound good?


• Sounds good. Let’s start the conversation—what part of the stack would you like to poke at first: how we store/manage authentication secrets, or entry points where cross-site attacks might
  sneak in (HTTP routes, rendered HTML, websockets, etc.)?


› I'm willing to start wherever you want. Generally I would think about this from a risk-management perspective, so given your general knowledge let's prioritize the highest risks first.


• From a risk-management lens, the two standout areas are:

  1. Authentication & secret handling – user emailSecret values are generated, stored in MySQL, and passed back through endpoints such as /regenerateemailsecret. We should confirm how those
     secrets are distributed (email only? UI?), whether they’re stored hashed or plaintext, and if any API responses or UI panes expose them unintentionally. That includes checking who can
     call /regenerateemailsecret, how setUserPrefs and getUserPrefs scrub the values, and whether secrets ever traverse query strings.
  2. Untrusted content rendering – feeds are inherently public, but injected HTML/JS could ride along via feed descriptions, river output, or likes feeds. Even with sanitize-html, we need to see
     which paths apply it (river rendering, blog editing, etc.) and whether there are holes (e.g., Markdown -> HTML conversions, template includes).

  I’d start with #1 (auth/secret flow) since a leak there gives an attacker full account impersonation. If that works for you, let’s dig into the emailSecret lifecycle: how it’s generated,
  stored, retrieved, and exposed to clients.


› Sounds good!

• I’m examining how email secrets are handled and finding that they’re stored in plaintext and passed in URL query strings for GET requests, which poses a serious security risk because these
  secrets can end up in logs and caches. I’ll highlight that addEmailToUserInDatabase returns the secret, getScreenname expects the secret in request params, and suggest shifting to cookie-based

• Looking at the emailSecret flow turned up two big issues:

  1. Secrets are stored and returned in plaintext.
      - addEmailToUserInDatabase and regenerateEmailSecret (feedland.js:710–812) generate a 10-character password and write it directly into users.emailSecret.
      - getUserRecFromEmail then matches on that value verbatim (feedland.js:892+), so nothing is ever hashed. Anyone with database read access or a path that leaks the value can impersonate a
        user instantly.
  2. Every authenticated request sends the secret in the query string.
      - getScreenname expects params.emailaddress and params.emailcode (feedland.js:945+) every time we wrap an endpoint with callWithScreenname. For GET routes (most of them), that means the
        secret sits in the URL (?emailcode=...).
      - Result: proxies, server logs, browsers, analytics, referrers, and even shared screenshots can capture the secret. Regenerating the code helps only after the damage is noticed.

  Risk-wise, #2 is the showstopper: a single intercepted URL gives full access. We should move to POST body or headers immediately, and ideally swap in a real session/token flow (cookie or
  Authorization header) with hashed storage. The plaintext storage is secondary but still worth fixing once the transport issue is addressed. Happy to dig into mitigation paths next if you
  agree.


› Let's do a full write-up explaining these issues along with recommended mitigations. Please keep in mind we have exactly 1 part-time developer working on this who is not a security expert,

  - Suggested lightweight mitigations (move credentials out of URLs, hash stored secrets, add operational guidance).
  - Logged future hardening ideas plus concrete next actions sized for a tiny team.

  Let me know when you’re ready to tackle the mitigation tasks.


› I'm not doing any code work here, just auditing and reviewing. What do you suggest we review next?


• Since we’ve examined authentication, I’d head straight into the second highest-risk area: untrusted content rendering. That means reviewing how feed item titles/descriptions, Markdown, and
  template includes are sanitized before we ship them back out (rivers, news products, likes feeds, the blog UI). Catching possible XSS or script-injection vectors now keeps users safe while
  Dave evangelizes. Once we catalog those pathways, we can decide if the existing sanitize-html coverage is enough or if we need additional filters.


› Let's go!


• I'm reviewing how feed items and user preferences are sanitized, focusing on sanitize-html usage in descriptions versus unsanitized titles. There’s a clear XSS risk because user-supplied
  news product titles and descriptions can be injected into HTML templates without escaping. I'll gather evidence from relevant functions like convertDatabaseItem, renderUserNewsproduct, and
  multipleReplaceAll to detail these injection points and recommend documenting these findings for security review.

─ Worked for 21s ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• Here’s what jumped out while tracing untrusted-content paths:

  ### 1. Feed items

  - database.getItemDescription runs every description through sanitize-html with a very tight allowlist (p and br only), so river JSON and API payloads are scrubbed.
  - Titles are not sanitized, but they travel back as JSON strings. Whether they become XSS hinges on the consuming UI (riverclient, etc.). If any client drops the title into the DOM with
    innerHTML, a malicious feed could inject markup. We should flag this for the downstream app or consider escaping titles at the API layer if we want to be defensive.

  ### 2. News product rendering (highest risk)

  - User-supplied fields (newsproductTitle, newsproductDescription, newsproductImage, plus the various newsproduct* prefs) are stored verbatim via setUserPrefs.
  - renderUserNewsproduct injects those values straight into the HTML template via utils.multipleReplaceAll—there’s no escaping/encoding step. A user could set newsproductTitle to <script>…</
    script> and everyone viewing that news product would execute it (classic stored XSS).
  - The template intentionally supports user CSS/JS (newsproductStyle, newsproductScript) so the owner can customize pages, but right now any user can inject scripts by editing those preferences
    —there’s no separation between “trusted Me” and “other viewers.” If that’s intentional, we need to document it. If not, a simple encodeHtml step (or sanitizing those fields when they’re
    saved) would close the hole.

  ### 3. Other templates / JSON

  - The JSON string userPrefs is embedded in the template as utils.jsonStringify(...), so quotes and backslashes are escaped: low risk.
  - Likes feeds, OPML exports, etc., all serialize the sanitized description and plain-text titles; same caveat as above.

  ### Suggested mitigations (lightweight)

  1. Add HTML escaping when substituting user prefs into templates. Even a simple helper that replaces <, >, &, " is enough. Do this for pageTitle, pageDescription, pageImage, etc., right before
     the template replacement.
  2. Decide on the policy for newsproductStyle / newsproductScript. If we want to keep inline scripting, document it as “owner-level tooling” and ensure only authenticated owners can change it.
     If we’d rather prevent arbitrary JS, strip <script> tags server-side before saving.
  3. Flag the title issue for client apps. At minimum, note in the testing/ops docs that any consumer must treat titles as untrusted and escape them before inserting into HTML. If we want to be
     extra safe, escape titles at the API level and let clients decode.

  Once we agree on the path (escape vs. allow), we can add these findings to securityReview.md alongside the auth notes. Let me know if you want me to draft that write-up.


› Before we document this, can you please update securityReview.md to make it a little more readable for non-technical audiences? I don't want to lose any detail, but Dave needs to be able to
  understand it!

• Rewrote notes/codeReviews/securityReview.md:1 in plainer language while preserving all the technical details and action items. Dave (and other non-security folks) should now be able to follow
  the risks and the mitigation plan. Ready whenever you want to capture the templating/XSS findings formally.


› Much better! Thanks. I'm re-reading the summary about data sanitization now. Give me a minute.


• Take your time—let me know when you’re ready to capture the templating findings or dive into the next area.


› As to your suggested mitigations about untrusted content, a brute-forct HTML escaping transformation might not work for this app, since it inherently wants to display formatted text. We might
  need to sanitize any HTML content to make it "safe" instead. Back when Dave and I worked together at UserLand, we had code that did this and which also respected a list of allowed HTML tags.
  It was called html.sanitize (if memory serves) and relied on an admin-configurable list of allowed HTML tags, so admins could (for example) allow or disallow <iframe> or <script> tags
  depending on their environment and trust level. I don't think we want to go that far right now, but we need to document the issue for sure. I definitely think it's important to protect
  against XSS attacks though. That's critical.


• Completely agree: escaping everything would break the authoring scenarios that make FeedLand useful. What we really need is HTML sanitization that preserves “allowed” formatting while
  stripping or neutralizing everything else.

  Here’s how I suggest we proceed (and what I’ll capture in the write-up):

  1. Call out the issue now
      - In the security review notes, we’ll document that news-product fields (newsproductTitle/Description/Image/Style/Script) and any other rich-text inputs are inserted straight into
        templates.
      - We’ll highlight that this is a stored XSS risk whenever someone pastes hostile markup.
  2. Short-term guardrails
      - Apply the existing sanitize-html helper (already used for feed descriptions) to those fields before rendering. We can extend its allowlist beyond p/br to cover reasonable formatting
        (e.g., a, em, strong, lists) so pages still look good.
      - If we want owners to keep their custom CSS/JS knobs, we can scope them to a “trusted mode” toggle or document clearly that adding scripts is intentionally dangerous.
  3. Future flexibility
      - Capture in the plan that we’d like an admin-adjustable allowlist like the old html.sanitize (possibly reusing config.legalTags or moving it to a shared config file), so installations
        with different threat models can permit additional tags.

  I’ll add a section to securityReview.md summarizing this and listing the above as immediate recommendation + longer-term idea. From there we can decide whether to spin a dedicated task to wire
  sanitize-html into the news-product rendering path.


› Go ahead please.

• Security notes now include the templating/XSS findings and sanitization plan in notes/codeReviews/securityReview.md:1. We call out the risk, recommend using sanitize-html (with an expanded
  tag allowlist), and log a future task for a configurable allowlist similar to the old UserLand approach. Yellow-highlight next steps include applying the sanitizer to news-product prefs and
  documenting allowed tags. Ready for the next audit area when you are.


› Ok, what's next?


• Next I’d turn to reliability and recovery: verify that backups (database.backupDatabase, nightly jobs) actually succeed, restore cleanly, and don’t miss critical tables like reading list
  subscriptions or likes. While adoption is still low, it’s the right time to run a dry-run restore and document the steps. That exercise also feeds into monitoring (alerts on backup failures)
  and gives confidence before the marketing push.


› Yep, makes sense. Go ahead. (This is one of those things that happens rarely, but when it does it's a huge PITA!)

• I'm examining the backup logic and config settings, noting it only backs up key tables for the previous day, missing readinglists and older items, which risks data loss if backups fail

  improving coverage and reliability.

  Everything else points at the new camelCase names. Let me know if you want any additional cross-links or README updates.


› (codeReviews/xxxReview.md didn't make sense since "review" was there twice)


• Exactly—thanks for renaming them; the new security.md, testing.md, and backups.md titles are cleaner and read better. All the docs and references now match that simpler naming. Whenever you
  spin up new deep dives (e.g., drDrill.md), they’ll fit the pattern without the double “review.”


› What are the next review areas?


• Here’s how I’d stack the remaining areas, highest impact first:

  1. Privacy & Data Handling
      - Verify where email addresses, secrets, and WordPress tokens live; document retention/erase steps. This piggybacks on the auth work and keeps us honest about user data promises.
  2. Observability & Monitoring
      - Make sure we can tell when things break (feed polling, backups, websockets). Even simple log markers or a health checklist will help Dave respond quickly while marketing ramps up.
  3. Dependency & Supply Chain Hygiene
      - Snapshot npm dependency versions, run npm audit, and note any Dave-owned packages that need coordinated updates. Low-effort, high confidence boost.
  4. Performance & Scale
      - Baseline /getriver, feed ingestion, and reading list checks with sample data. This feeds your testing roadmap and ensures we aren’t blindsided by traffic spikes.

  Once those are covered, we can circle back to softer items like documentation/support readiness or legal/compliance notes. Let me know which one you’d like to jump into next (my pick would be
  Privacy & Data Handling, since it’s a direct follow-through from the auth work).


› How would you weigh these against setting up a robust unit test framework?


• If we weigh impact versus effort for a two-person, part-time crew:

  - Security/privacy issues (auth secrets, data handling) are existential. A credential leak or accidental disclosure can burn trust overnight, so finishing that thread should stay on top.
  - Observability/backup gaps are the next safety net: when something breaks, you need to know immediately.
  - Unit-test framework is critical for long-term velocity, but it shines once the core risks are under control. It does take up-front time (fixtures, harness, CI), so slipping it just behind
    the high-risk remediation is reasonable.
  - Dependency hygiene/performance baselines are lower risk and can move after tests are in place.

  So: clean up auth/privacy + monitoring first, then invest in the foundational unit/integration test scaffolding. Once the test harness exists, we can address dependency updates and performance
  testing with less fear of regressions.
